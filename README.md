- I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology, having an enthusiasm for learning a wide array of technologies, aspiring to infuse the best of skills from each of them while also being sufficiently adaptive.
- I have tried my hands on projects ranging from Web-Dev to Machine Learning to Game development.
- I am always up for exploring something new and trying my hands on any interesting automation/projects.
